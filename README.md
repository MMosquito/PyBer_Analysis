# PyBer_Analysis

OVERVIEW

  The purpose of the new analysis is to show the PyBer CEO the ride-sharing data by city type, the total weekly fares for each city type, how the data differs by city type, and how those differences can be used by decision-makers to address any disparities among the city types.  


RESULTS

  The new analysis shows a significant difference in the total rides by city type. The Urban area far exceeds the Rural areas by more than 13 times in total rides, providing a significant amount of total fares for PyBer. Although the driver's Average Fare is $55.49 the total rides are minimal. They have more opportunity in the Urban areas.

  The graph below provides a visual of the disparity amongst fares by type. The Rural areas appear to be more consistant within this four month window than both the Rural and Suburban areas.

SUMMARY

  The new analysis and clear images clearly identify the disparities among the city types. The data collected provides a closer look into the cities, dates, and fares per ride.  With this information you will be able to better utilize your drivers in a specific area during a specific time of year. 

    Business Recommendations:
1.  Decrease the overall amount of drivers in the Rural areas.
2.  Monitor the amount of drivers needed in each area based on time of year (increase and decrease as necessary)
3.  Adjust fare per ride based when on time of year (increase and decrease as necessary)
